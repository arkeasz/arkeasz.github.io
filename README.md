This site is treated as a versioned project rather than a static page.
Each release represents a snapshot of my skills, design decisions, and technical focus at a given time.

## Overview

- Minimalist, content-first design
- Inspired by terminal / CLI aesthetics
- Focused on projects rather than buzzwords
- No unnecessary frameworks or abstractions

## Philosophy

This portfolio is intentionally simple.

I prefer:
- clarity over visual noise
- explicit structure over hidden magic
- small, understandable systems over large dependencies

The goal is to make both the content and the implementation easy to read.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: <Astro / Vue >
- Styling: <CSS>
- Hosting: <Github-pages>
- Tooling: <Vite / npm>


## Releases

This project follows semantic versioning.

- **v1.0.0** – Initial public release  
  Baseline version of the portfolio, defining layout, structure, and visual language.

Future releases may include:
- content updates
- UI/UX refinements
- performance improvements
- experiments and redesigns
- blog
